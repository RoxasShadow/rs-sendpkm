It's a fake Pokémon GTS server.
rs-sendpkm.py is modificated version of ir-gts'sendpkm.py <http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/>.
To install, just copy `sendpkm.py` on /ir-gts/src/.
Tested only on ir-gts 0.43 <http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/>

Feature added:
	Giving a path, rs-sendpkm gives casually one of the .pkm/.3gpkm files which are in the directory at the game;
	Otherwise of kill himself, when it gives a Pokémon at the game, rs-sendpkm waits another game to gives it another Pokémon, while it isn't killed;
	Drag & drop;
	A couple of rows to optimize the code.
